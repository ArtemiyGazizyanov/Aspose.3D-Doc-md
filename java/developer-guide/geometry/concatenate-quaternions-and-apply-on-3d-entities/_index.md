Aspose.3D for Java allows developers to combine two rotation transformation into one represented in a quaternion.

## **Concatenate Quaternions**
Quaternions are used to represent an orientation in 3D space. The concat method exposed by the **Quaternion** class can be used to combine two quaternions. In this code example, we combine two quaternions and get a third resulting quaternion, and then apply these three quaternions to three cylinders.
### **Programming Sample**
This code example combine two quaternions and apply them to different cylinders.
