# Aspose.3D for .NET : Concatenate Quaternions and apply on 3D entities


[Aspose.3D for .NET](https://www.aspose.com/products/3d) allows developers to combine two rotation transformation into one represented in a quaternion.

## ConcatenateÂ Quaternions

Quaternions are used to represent an orientation in 3D space. The `Concat` method exposed by the [Quaternion](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/3d/aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion) class can be used to combine two quaternions. In this code example, we combine two quaternions and get a third resulting quaternion, and then apply these three quaternions to three cylinders.

### Programming Sample

This code example combine two quaternions and apply them to different cylinders.

**  
Result in 3ds MAX**
