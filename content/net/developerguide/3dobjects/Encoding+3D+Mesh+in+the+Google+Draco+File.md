Aspose.3D for .NET : Encoding 3D Mesh in the Google Draco File  

# Aspose.3D for .NET : Encoding 3D Mesh in the Google Draco File


[Aspose.3D for .NET](https://www.aspose.com/products/3d/net) API allows developers to [import a 3D model](https://docs2.aspose.com/3d/net/developerguide/creatingloadingandsaving3dscene/create+and+read+an+existing+3d+scene#createandreadanexisting3dscene-readinga3dscene), and then encode meshes in the Google Draco files. Developers can also specify the position, texture coordinates, color and normal bits as well as the compression level before encoding a mesh.

## Retrieve a 3D Mesh and Encode in Google Draco File

The `Encode` method exposed by the [DracoFormat](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/3d/aspose.threed.formats/dracoformat) class can be used to encode a 3d mesh in the Google Draco file. It takes a [Mesh](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/3d/aspose.threed.entities/mesh) and [DracoSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/3d/aspose.threed.formats.draco/dracosaveoptions) objects as parameters. Using the Draco save options, developers can also specify the position, texture coordinates, color and normal bits as well as the compression level before encoding a mesh.

### Programming Sample

This code example retrieves a Mesh of Sphere, and then encode in the Google Draco file after specifying a compression level.
