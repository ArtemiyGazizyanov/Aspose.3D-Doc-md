Aspose.3D for .NET : Generate Normal Data for All Meshes in a 3D File  

# Aspose.3D for .NET : Generate Normal Data for All Meshes in a 3D File


Using [Aspose.3D for .NET](http://www.aspose.com/3d-component-suite.aspx), developers can generate normal data for all meshes in any 3D model (without the normal data).

## Generate Normal Data for All Meshes in a 3DS File

The `GenerateNormal` method exposed by the [PolygonModifier](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/3d/aspose.threed.entities/polygonmodifier) class can be used to generate normal data for all meshes in a 3DS file. If `VertexElementSmoothingGroup` element was defined in the mesh, the generated normal data will get smoothed by the `VertexElementSmoothingGroup`.

### Programming Sample

This code example loads a 3DS file, visit all nodes and create normal data for all meshes.
