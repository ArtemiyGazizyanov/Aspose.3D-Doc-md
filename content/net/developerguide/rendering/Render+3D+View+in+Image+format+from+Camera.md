## Take a Picture of 3D Model from the Camera

The `Render` method exposed by the [Scene](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/3d/aspose.threed/scene) class can be used to take a picture from the active camera. Developers may also use the several different ways to navigate and position the camera in the scene. In this code example, we create a camera at position (10,10,10) in an existing 3D scene and look at the origin point for rendering.

### Programming Sample

This code example creates a camera in a 3D scene, sets its target and render an image.
