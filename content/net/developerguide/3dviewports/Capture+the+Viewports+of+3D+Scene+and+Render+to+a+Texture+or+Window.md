Aspose.3D for .NET : Capture the Viewports of 3D Scene and Render to a Texture or Window  

# Aspose.3D for .NET : Capture the Viewports of 3D Scene and Render to a Texture or Window


Each 3D scene can comprise of any number of viewports. Using [Aspose.3D for .NET API](http://www.aspose.com/3d-component-suite.aspx), developers can capture one or more viewports in a single screenshot. They may render it in the GUI based .NET application or an image.

## Capturing and Rendering the Viewports of 3D Scene

The `CreateRenderTexture` and `CreateRenderWindow` methods exposed by the [RenderFactory](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/3d/aspose.threed.render/renderfactory) class can be used to create a new render target that renders the scene to a texture or Window.

### Programming Sample

This code example captures a viewport of 3D Scene and renders it in two different ways.
