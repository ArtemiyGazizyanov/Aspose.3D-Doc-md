### Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

See the list of any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.3D for .NET. If you have concerns about any change listed, please raise it on the [Aspose.3D support forum](http://www.aspose.com/community/forums/aspose.3d-product-family/535/showforum.aspx).

#### Adds Aspose.ThreeD.Shading.PbrMaterial Class

The recent release of Aspose.3D for .NET API has added support of PBR (Physically Based Rendering) material. Developers can apply PBR material to entities and render into 3D models.

This code example demonstrates how to apply PBR material to an entity:

**.NET, C#**

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
Scene scene = new Scene();
PbrMaterial mat = new PbrMaterial();
mat.MetallicFactor = 0.9;//an almost metal material
mat.RoughnessFactor = 0.9;//material surface is very rough
//create a box that applied this material
var boxNode = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode("box", new Box());
boxNode.Material = mat;
{{< /code >}}

#### Member updates to Aspose.ThreeD.FileFormat Class

To import GLTF 2.0 (ASCII & Binary) files into Aspose.3D API, two members (GLTF2 & GLTF2\_Binary) are added to Aspose.ThreeD.FileFormat Class.

This code example demonstrates how to import GLTF 2.0 ASCII or Binary file:

**.NET, C#**

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
/********************** New Members **********************/
public static readonly Aspose.ThreeD.FileFormat GLTF2;
public static readonly Aspose.ThreeD.FileFormat GLTF2_Binary;
Â 
/******************** Import GLTF 2.0 ********************/
//Create a new scene
var s = new Scene();
//Load it as GLTF2, the second argument is optional since Aspose.3D can detect the actual file type
s.Open("test.gltf", FileFormat.GLTF2);
{{< /code >}}
