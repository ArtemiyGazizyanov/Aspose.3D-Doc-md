Aspose.3D for Java : Build Tangent and Binormal data for all Meshes in 3D Model  

# Aspose.3D for Java : Build Tangent and Binormal data for all Meshes in 3D Model


With Aspose.3D for Java API, developers can build tangent and binormal data for all meshes in any supported 3D document.

## Build Tangent and Binormal data for Mesh

We have added two **`BuildTangentBinormal`** methods in the **PolygonModifier** class. One method takes the **Scene** class object as a parameter and another one takes the **Mesh** class object as a parameter as shown in this code example:
