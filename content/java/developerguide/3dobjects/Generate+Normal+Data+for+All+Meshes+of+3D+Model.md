Aspose.3D for Java : Generate Normal Data for All Meshes of 3D Model  

# Aspose.3D for Java : Generate Normal Data for All Meshes of 3D Model


Aspose.3D for Java API has support of generating normal data for all meshes of 3D model (without the normal data).

## Generate Normal Data for All Meshes of 3DS Model

The `generateNormal` method exposed by the **PolygonModifier** class can be used to generate normal data for all meshes in a 3DS file. If `VertexElementSmoothingGroup` element was defined in the mesh, the generated normal data will get smoothed by the `VertexElementSmoothingGroup`.

### Programming Sample

This code example loads a 3DS file, visit all nodes and create normal data for all meshes.
