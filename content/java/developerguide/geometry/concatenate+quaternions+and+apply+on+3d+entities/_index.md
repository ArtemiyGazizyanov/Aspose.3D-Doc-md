# Aspose.3D for Java : Concatenate Quaternions and apply on 3D entities


Aspose.3D for Java allows developers to combine two rotation transformation into one represented in a quaternion.

## Concatenate Quaternions

Quaternions are used to represent an orientation in 3D space. The `concat` method exposed by the **Quaternion** class can be used to combine two quaternions. In this code example, we combine two quaternions and get a third resulting quaternion, and then apply these three quaternions to three cylinders.

### Programming Sample

This code example combine two quaternions and apply them to different cylinders.

  
  

**Result in 3ds MAX**
