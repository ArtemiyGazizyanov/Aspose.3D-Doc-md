## List of 3D supported formats (import)

Aspose.3D for Java API has support of reading various type of 3D documents. The available constructors of the **Scene** class helps to do so and they accept a valid file path string. The supported readable file formats are as follows:

1.  FBX 7.5 (ASCII, Binary)
2.  FBX 7.4 (ASCII, Binary)
3.  FBX 7.3 (ASCII, Binary)
4.  FBX 7.2 (ASCII, Binary)
5.  STL (ASCII, Binary)
6.  WavefrontOBJ
7.  Discreet3DS
8.  Universal3D
9.  Collada
10.  glTF
11.  DXF
12.  PLY (ASCII, Binary)
13.  X (ASCII, Binary)
14.  Draco
15.  3MF
16.  RVM (Text, Binary)
17.  ASE

The constructors of Scene class detect 3D document format internally.

## Import 3D document

Aspose.3D for Java API has support of importing various types of 3D document for the modification, addition and processing purposes.

## Working with 3D Properties

Aspose.3D API lets you read 3D Scene properties using the scene's child nodes. The following code sample demonstrates the usage of this feature.
