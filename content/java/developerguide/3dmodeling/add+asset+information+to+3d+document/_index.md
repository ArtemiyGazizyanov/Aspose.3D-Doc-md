## Add Asset Information to 3D document

Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates or makes it easier to retrieve, use or manage an information resource. Aspose.3D for Java API has support to define Metadata for the scene.

### Define a Metadata for the scene

3D shows produce massive qunatities of metadata and picture information. Metadata is an asset and part of the show.

1.  Initialize a 3D Scene using **Scene** class.
2.  Set application/tool name.
3.  Set application/tool vendor name.
4.  Set measurement unit.
5.  Set measurement unit scale factor.
6.  Save 3D scene in the supported file format.

In this example, we assume the scene is created by a CAD tool called “Egypt” and it’s designed by “Manualdesk”:
