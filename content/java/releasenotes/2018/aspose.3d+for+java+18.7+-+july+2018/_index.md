### Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

Please view the list of any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.3D for Java API. If you have concerns about any change listed, please raise it on theÂ [Aspose.3D support forum](https://forum.aspose.com/c/3d).

### API changes:

#### 3 members removed from class com.aspose.threed.Property:

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
    public void com.aspose.threed.Property.setExtraData(java.lang.String);
    public java.lang.String com.aspose.threed.Property.getExtraData();
    public int com.aspose.threed.Property.getFlags();
{{< /code >}}

These are removed to synchronize the changes from .NET version. (They are scheduled to be removed since Aspose.3D for .NET 18.2)

#### 1 property added to class com.aspose.threed.ObjLoadOptions:

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
    public boolean com.aspose.threed.ObjLoadOptions.getNormalizeNormal();
    public void com.aspose.threed.ObjLoadOptions.setNormalizeNormal(boolean);
{{< /code >}}

Gets or sets whether to normalize the normal vector during the loading, default value is true.

##### Sample code:

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
        Scene scene = new Scene();
        ObjLoadOptions opt = new ObjLoadOptions();
        opt.setNormalizeNormal(false);
        scene.open("test.obj", opt);
{{< /code >}}

This will load the obj file and leave the normal vectors unnormalized, the old version will normalize the normal vectors when obj file loaded.
